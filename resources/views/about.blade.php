    Delete Fox News!

        The idea of Delete Fox News came to me when I was surprised to find out how many people I knew had parents and relatives that watched Fox News religiously. People whom I believed would be smart enough to take a critical lense to the content they would be seeing. It was then that I decided to make a site where I can show anyone how to delete or at the very least, use parental controls, to block the channel from the lineup. All the info given is public information.

        If setting a timer on electronic devices is too difficult for some, I suppose reversing the block would be too.
